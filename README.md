# Lung-Cancer-Prediction
Lung Cancer Project
This project takes a deep dive into the data of patients diagnosed with lung cancer and uncovers the underlying factors that contribute to this deadly disease. The aim is to use data science techniques to shed light on the impact of various risk factors on lung cancer, including air pollution, alcohol use, and occupational hazards.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The first step in this project was to clean and preprocess the data to ensure it was ready for analysis. This involved identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations
Once the data was cleaned and preprocessed, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of different variables and their relationships with each other. We used various visualization techniques such as scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to identify any patterns or trends in the data.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial step in any machine learning project. In this project, we created new features from the existing data to help improve the performance of our models. These features included age, sex, smoking status, and exposure to various environmental risk factors.

Modeling
We used several machine learning models to predict lung cancer based on the data. These models included logistic regression, k-means clustering, and PCA. We used SHAP values and chi-squared contingency tests to identify the most important features contributing to the models' performance.

Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the models' performance, we used several metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also used the Enorm metric, which is a novel metric that measures the model's ability to predict high-risk patients with a low false-positive rate.

Conclusion
Through this project, we were able to uncover some interesting insights into the causes of lung cancer. We found that exposure to environmental risk factors such as air pollution and occupational hazards is strongly associated with the disease. Our models also demonstrated high accuracy in predicting lung cancer, indicating that machine learning techniques can be useful in predicting and preventing the disease.
